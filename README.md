## Containers Mirror

</div>

The origins of this repository are a clone of [onedr0p's container-mirror repository](https://github.com/onedr0p/containers-mirror) which I encourage you leverage instead of anything here.  [onedr0p](https://github.com/onedr0p) and any other contributors listed by the aforementioned repository are to be credited with all the work and maintanence in providing quality containers for the community and public at large.  The purpose of this repository is mainly for my own personal use to learn CI/CD.
